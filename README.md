## Reflection

What do you see as the benefits and downsides of working with linked lists instead of arrays? When might they be most useful versus limiting?
I think the non-linearity makes working with linked lists a benefit compared to arrays, as they're not limited to size, and one can choose to insert and delete at random sections, but when looking for a specific elements, arrays would be more useful.

What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
The major challenge I faced in completing this assignment was turning my prototype into actual code. Furthermore, I had some issues running the tests for my assignment.

What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
I feel I've learned a little more on how useful Linked Lists are compared to arrays, and possibly also when I could choose to use them.
